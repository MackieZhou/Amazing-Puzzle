<p>Bored by problem sets and papers? Here come the <strong>ultimate crazy puzzles</strong>!!! Choose a difficult level and challenge yourself!
1. <strong>How to win?</strong>
    - Cover the two static grey squares by the two colored squares at the same time, and you win!
1. <strong>How to play?</strong>
    - Firstly, you want to choose a <strong>difficult level</strong>. You have difficult level 9, 99, and 999 to choose from.
    - Secondly, play! Control the movement of the red square and the blue square by hitting the <strong>left, right, up, or down arrow keys</strong> on your keyboard. Each keyboard hit has effect on both colored squares, though it's possible that only one square will move.
1. <strong>Any rules?</strong>
    - Unfortunately, you <strong>cannot move across a wall</strong>. (If there's a wall on the left side of the red square and you hit the left arrow key, the red square won't move!) It means you may get into a situation where one square moves, but the other does not.
    - Pay attention to the numbers around the arena. If you <strong>move a colored square out</strong> of the arena from one side of a tile, the colored square will <strong>come back</strong> into the arena from the other tile that has <strong>the same number</strong> marked next to it.
    - The two colored squares <strong>must not overlap</strong>.</p>
