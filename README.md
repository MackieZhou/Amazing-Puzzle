### Game Description
Bored by problem sets and papers? Here comes the **ultimate crazy puzzles**!!! Choose the difficult level and challenge yourself!
1. **How do I win?**
    - Cover the two static grey squares at the same time then you win!
1. **How to play?**
    - Firstly, you want to choose a **difficult level**. You have difficult level 9, 99, and 999 to choose from.
    - Secondly, play! Control the movement of the red square and the blue square by hitting the **left, right, up, or down arrow keys** on your keyboard.
1. **Any rules?**
    - Unfortunately, you **cannot move across a wall**. (If there's a wall on the left side of the red square and you hit the left arrow key, the red square won't move!) It means you may get into a situation where one square moves, but the other one does not.
    - Pay attention to the numbers around the arena. If you move a colored square **out of** the arena from one side of a tile, the colored square will **back into** the arena from the other tile that has **the same number** marked next to it.
    - The two colored squares **must not overlap**.
