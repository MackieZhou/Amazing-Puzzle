### Game Description
Bored by problem sets and papers? Let our  **Amazing Puzzle** sharp your brain! Choose a difficulty level and challenge yourself!
1. **How to win?**
    - Let the red and blue square overlap the two static grey squares.
1. **How to play?**
    - Choose a **difficulty level** from level 9, 99, and 999.
    - Control the movement of the red square and the blue square by hitting the **left, right, up, or down arrow keys** on your keyboard. 
1. **Any rules?**
    - The two squares **move together** (i.e. when you hit up arrow key, both squares will move up a grid)
    - **Stop when hitting a wall**. If only one of the square is stoped by the wall, the other one will move normally (this is a strategy you can use to only move one square).
    - The squares will be **transported by the numbers** around the game board. All the numbers appear in pairs and they are like a channel between two grids. If you move a colored square out of the board from one number, the square will reappear in the other grid represented by the same number.
    - **No overlap** of the two squares.
1. **Everything will be clear when you try it out!**
